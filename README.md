# Apache-Log-File-Processor
Academic Project: This program reads in a file in Apache Log File format and parses the information so that it can be stored as different type of data. This was implemented by rewriting the String data type using a char dynamic array. Tested by implementing modular test files and running them through instructor provided test oracles.
